/**
 * The local bridge: answer the panel from Claude Code instead of the API.
 *
 * Why it exists. The API backend is metered and needs a key sitting in
 * browser storage. This one uses the subscription already on the machine and
 * puts no key in the browser at all. What it costs instead is that it only
 * works here, only while this process is running.
 *
 * It speaks the **same wire format** the API backend does — POST a Messages
 * body, read Anthropic-shaped SSE back — so the extension's `streamChat()`
 * parses both without knowing which answered. That was the point of putting
 * the seam there.
 *
 * Run it:
 *   node bridge/server.mjs            # 127.0.0.1:8787
 *   node bridge/server.mjs --port 9000
 *
 * Zero dependencies, like the rest of this repo.
