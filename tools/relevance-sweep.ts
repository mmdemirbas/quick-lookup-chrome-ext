/**
 * Live relevance sweep against real Wikipedia.
 *
 * Unit tests pin the mechanism against the cases that were reported. They
 * cannot say whether the behaviour is better across the words actually
 * selected in a day, because that depends on what a live search engine
 * returns — and that is where relevance work goes wrong. A guard that looks
 * principled in a test can be too strict for half the words in the corpus,
 * and nothing in the suite would say so.
 *
 * `nothing` is a legitimate and often correct expectation: it means the
 * entity slot stays empty and the page's own sentence plus the dictionary
 * answer instead, which for `manifest` on the Iceberg documentation is the
 * better card.
 *
 * Run with `npm run sweep`. Outside `npm run check` for the same reason as
 * the smoke test: it needs a network, and Wikipedia being slow is not a
 * reason to block a commit. The 250 ms pause between cases is there because
 * a burst gets rate-limited; the extension never issues one.
